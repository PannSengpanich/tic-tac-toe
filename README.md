# tic-tac-toe

The Tic Tac Toe project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Course. It is a simple game application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is a two-player game in which players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game application that can be played by two players. This project will help developers to practice their JavaScript programming skills, understand how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, and explore different ways of implementing game logic.

The project provides an opportunity to practice working on:

1. Manipulating the DOM using JavaScript: In this project, developers will learn how to manipulate the HTML elements of a web page using JavaScript. They will also learn how to listen to events, such as mouse clicks, and handle them accordingly.

2. Implementing game logic: Developers will learn how to implement the game logic for Tic Tac Toe. This involves checking if a player has won the game, updating the game board with each move, and handling ties.
(To create the Tic Tac Toe game, I used the Connect Four game code provided by the course as a reference and modified its logic to suit the rules of Tic Tac Toe.)

3. Using CSS for styling: The project also provides an opportunity to practice using CSS to style the game board and other elements of the web page.
