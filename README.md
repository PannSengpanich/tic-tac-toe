# tic-tac-toe

The Tic Tac Toe project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Course. It is a simple game application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is a two-player game in which players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game application that can be played by two players. This project will help developers to practice their JavaScript programming skills, understand how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, and explore different ways of implementing game logic.
